**What the project does**

This project seeks to create the ideal travel experience website.

The website will store all of the user's individual pictures on a firebase server. When the picture is saved to the database, the user clicks on an image and the map is updated to show where the image was taken.

The user can then look up the cheapest flights for all of their future adventures.
